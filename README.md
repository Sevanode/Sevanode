# Hi, I‚Äôm Juan üëã  

I‚Äôm a 3rd-year Computer Science student at **Florida Atlantic University** with a passion for building tools that make life easier. I first got into coding after watching videos that sparked my curiosity, and that curiosity quickly grew into a full-on career path.  

I enjoy creating projects that have real-world impact ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs automating repetitive tasks or building web apps that people can actually use. My experience spans **web development** and **data analysis**, with a strong foundation in Python as well as modern web technologies.  

What excites me most about coding is the ability to take an idea and turn it into something useful entirely on my own. The fact that a few lines of code can grow into a tool that helps others still feels amazing every time.
